                <p class="article-content">Women in Indonesia earn less money on average per month
                    than men as the gender pay gap stood at nearly 23 percent
                    in February, official data show, as female workers face
                    undervalued work and inflexible working conditions.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Women earned on average Rp 2.45 million (US$166.39) per
                    month in February, marking an annual increase of 5 percent,
                    according to survey data from Statistics Indonesia (BPS).
                    Men earned higher on average at Rp 3.18 million per month,
                    an increase of 4.3 percent over the same period.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">The inequality has slightly narrowed as the gender pay gap,
                    the difference between the average wages of men and those
                    of women as a percentage of men’s wages, was slightly
                    higher at 23.44 percent in the same month last year.
                    However, the wage gap has not improved very much from the
                    level seen in February 2010 at 23.64 percent.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">The gender pay gap was estimated at 16 percent at the
                    global level, according to a news release from the
                    International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United
                    Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of
                    Women (UN Women).
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">“Unless we address the systemic inequalities that put
                    women in low paid, undervalued work and inflexible working
                    conditions that limit their opportunities, we will not be able to
                    close the gender pay gap,” Jamshed Kazi, UN Women
                    Indonesia representative and liaison to ASEAN, was quoted
                    in the news release as saying on Thursday.

                <p class="article-content">The wage disparity exacerbates the uneven impact of the
                    COVID-19 pandemic on women, since most of them work in
                    hard-hit industries such as accommodation, food and
                    beverages, sales and manufacturing.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Women have also been disproportionately affected as most
                    of them work in the informal and underpaid sectors. Less
                    than half of them work as professionals, according to an
                    estimate from the Finance Ministry.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">While other factors like educational background may play a
                    role, most studies consider discrimination the stronger
                    factor driving the wage inequality between men and women,
                    Diahhadi Setyonaluri, an economist at the Demographic
                    Institute at the University of Indonesia (UI), has said.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Men had a better chance of climbing the career ladder in part
                    because there were “implicit problems” embedded in job
                    promotion, Diahhadi added.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Women, for example, tended to turn down promotion offers
                    that would move them from their current city when their
                    children were already attending school and their husband
                    worked there, she said.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">“Imagine if there was zero gender wage gap, there would be
                    additional income,” Diahhadi told The Jakarta Post in a
                    phone interview on Friday. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">“The easiest way to see it is to consider its impact on the
                    national income or economic growth. With no wage
                    inequality, our economic growth may increase by several
                    percentage points,” she added.

                <p class="article-content">The ILO Indonesia stated that “education alone does not
                    close the gender pay gap.” Among university graduates,
                    women earned 31.9 percent less than their male
                    counterparts, according to BPS data. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Aviliani, an economist at the Institute for Development of
                    Economics and Finance (Indef), said Friday the wage gap
                    was smaller for higher managerial positions, for which the
                    wage was based more heavily on skills. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Women in high managerial positions earn on average Rp 5.9
                    million every month and men Rp 7.23 million, according to
                    BPS data. The difference is a wage gap of 18.31 percent,
                    slightly below the overall wage gap.                    
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">“Women in lower positions tend to think about their family
                    first regardless of the pay they receive, while men tend to
                    negotiate,” Aviliani told the Post in a phone interview.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Manpower Minister Ida Fauziyah said Indonesia still
                    considered wage equality between men and women
                    important since the country ratified in 1958 the ILO
                    Convention on Equal Remuneration.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">“Given the gender gap in our labor market today, my ministry,
                    together with all of our social partners and international
                    organizations, continues to reinforce our joint actions
                    against gender-based discrimination at work. It is time for
                    women and men to be equally appreciated by their talents,
                    work results and competence, not by their gender,” Ida was
                    quoted in the news release as saying.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Closing the gender wage gap can be achieved by
                    emphasizing the important role trade unions can play,
                    according to Elly Silaban, the president of the Confederation

            <div class="article">
                <p class="article-content">South Korea has long lagged other developed countries in
                    promoting equal pay between women and men, and the
                    small progress it has made in recent years is facing a
                    setback as the Covid-19 shock disproportionately hits
                    female workers.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">South Korean women took home 32.5% less income than
                    men last year -- the widest pay gap among 37 member
                    countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
                    Development, where the average gap is 13%. The disparity
                    risks getting worse this year. Women account for two thirds
                    of the country’s job losses since March as the pandemic hits
                    service-sector and non-regular jobs, where women vastly
                    outnumber men.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Some have held on to their jobs but suffered wage cuts, such
                    as Park Myeong-soon, a 64-old female cleaner at a
                    university in the South Korean city of Incheon. The virus
                    outbreak has meant fewer in-person classes and rotation
                    shifts to reduce infection risk among the cleaners. This has
                    brought less work and reduced pay for Park.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">“This is a big problem for people like me who live paycheck
                    to paycheck,” she said by phone. “It is the most stressful
                    time and I fear this Covid situation is going to last longer.”
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">The vulnerability of female workers amid the pandemic is not
                    unique to South Korea. The situation isn’t much better in
                    Japan, where women have accounted for a majority of the
                    jobs lost since the outbreak, while also bearing the burden of
                    rearing homebound children. In the U.S., this crisis has been
                    described as a “shecession” for its greater impact on
                    women.

                    making headway in attracting more women into the
                    workforce by promoting policies such as flexible work hours
                    and paid parental leave.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Before the pandemic struck, women had outpaced male jobs
                    gains since 2015. The gender pay gap had narrowed from
                    37.2% over the same period.

                    It remains uncertain whether the jobs women lost will be
                    restored as the economy recovers, with Covid-19 reshaping
                    the way businesses operate.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">“Women are the first to take a hit when there’s an economic
                    crisis from the Asian financial crisis to Covid-19,” Bae
                    Eun-kyung, a sociology professor at Seoul National
                    University, said at a forum this month. “And when the jobs
                    situation improves, women again end up taking worse jobs
                    than men.”
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">The OECD said in its South Korea economic survey in August
                    that the Covid-19 crisis is exacerbating the country’s
                    inequalities. It suggested the government regularly publish
                    its analysis of wages outcomes to achieve fairer pay across
                    genders.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">The collapse in female jobs in South Korea is due their
                    outsized presence in face-to-face service positions, as well
                    as in non-regular positions more prone to lay-offs. Around
                    31% of the country’s female workers held services or sales
                    jobs last year, almost double the share of men.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Even among those holding similar jobs -- like Park the
                    cleaner and her male co-workers -- the common gender
                    division of labor has impacted her female colleagues more
                    as the virus rages.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Park said in her university, men worked outside, cleaning
                    parking lots and lawns, while women mostly cleaned indoor
                    bathrooms and classrooms. She said this has meant men
                    were saved from being split into rotation groups to reduce
                    infection risk and experienced no wage cut.

                <p class="article-content">Government Policy <br>
                    South Korea’s gender situation lags its status as the home to
                    some of the world’s most advanced companies, such as
                    Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc.                   
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">The gap remains wide in leadership positions. The share of
                    women holding managerial posts in state-funded and large
                    private companies was 19.8% last year, down from 20.6% in
                    2018, statistics office data show. South Korean women hold
                    just 19% of assembly seats, below the global average of 25%
                    in data compiled by the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
                </p>
                <p class="article-content">Much of the government’s stimulus this year, including the
                    proposed fourth extra budget, has focused on protecting
                    vulnerable jobs and workers, but hasn’t done much in
                    resolving gender inequality.

                <p class="article-content">“Governments may provide support for each sector but they
                    find it difficult to do so for a specific gender, because job
                    choices were individual,” said Joseph Han, an economist at
                    the Korea Development Institute.
